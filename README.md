This project serves as example. I use [Sticker Knight Platformer](https://github.com/coronalabs/Sticker-Knight-Platformer) game and have replaced [Ponytiled](https://github.com/ponywolf/ponytiled) with [Berry](https://github.com/ldurniat/Berry) library. 

Original game was created by Ponywolf and it is available on github and marketplace for free.

Tested with Tiled 1.3.1
